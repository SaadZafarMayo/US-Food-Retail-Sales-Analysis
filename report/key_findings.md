# Key Findings – US Food & Retail Sales Analysis

## Purpose
This section summarizes high-level patterns observed during exploratory and
analytical SQL queries. Findings are descriptive in nature and focus on trends,
relationships, and structural characteristics rather than absolute outcomes.

## Overall Sales Behavior
- Sales data shows observable variation across time, indicating the presence of
  both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations.
- Month-over-month analysis highlights periods of acceleration and deceleration
  in total sales activity.
- The structure of the data supports further trend and growth analysis at
  multiple aggregation levels.

## Industry-Level Characteristics
- Sales distribution across industries is uneven, with some industries accounting
  for a larger share of total sales than others.
- Certain industries display relatively stable sales patterns over time, while
  others exhibit higher variability.
- Industry-level aggregation provides a foundation for identifying potential
  areas of sustained demand or volatility.

## Business Concentration
- Within industries, sales are not evenly distributed across businesses.
- A limited number of business types often contribute a significant portion of
  total industry sales.
- This concentration pattern is relevant when assessing market structure and
  dependency risks.

## Temporal & Seasonal Patterns
- Monthly aggregation reveals recurring seasonal effects in sales behavior.
- Peaks and troughs appear consistently across multiple time periods.
- These patterns suggest that timing plays an important role in overall sales
  performance.

## Sub-Industry (NAICS) Structure
- Aggregation by NAICS codes highlights differences in sales contribution across
  sub-industries.
- Major NAICS groups capture a substantial portion of total sales, while smaller
  sub-industries contribute incrementally.
- The NAICS structure enables comparison between mature and emerging segments.

## Growth & Change Signals
- Year-over-year comparisons identify periods of growth, decline, and
  stabilization at both industry and business levels.
- Growth signals vary in strength and consistency across segments.
- These observations support deeper evaluation of long-term performance trends.

## Analytical Value
The insights generated through SQL-based exploration provide a structured view
of the retail landscape and establish a basis for investment, expansion, or
forecasting analyses.
