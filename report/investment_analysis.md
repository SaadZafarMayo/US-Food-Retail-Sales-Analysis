# Investment & Expansion Assessment  
## US Food & Retail Sales

## Objective
The objective of this report is to demonstrate a structured analytical approach
to evaluating historical retail sales data using SQL. The focus is on identifying
patterns, trends, and structural characteristics that can inform investment or
expansion decisions.

## Analytical Scope
- Time-based analysis (monthly and yearly)
- Industry- and business-level aggregation
- Sub-industry (NAICS) segmentation
- Growth and contribution analysis

This report does not aim to provide financial advice but rather to showcase
data-driven reasoning.

## Data Preparation
- Raw sales data was staged and cleaned prior to analysis.
- Missing or invalid sales values were identified and standardized.
- Data types were normalized to enable accurate aggregations and calculations.

## Market Structure Analysis
Industry-level aggregation highlights how total sales are distributed across
different sectors. This approach enables evaluation of:
- Relative scale between industries
- Stability versus volatility across time
- Structural dominance of specific segments

Understanding market structure is a prerequisite for informed strategic decisions.

## Growth & Momentum Evaluation
Year-over-year and month-over-month comparisons were used to assess change over
time. This method allows analysts to:
- Identify sustained growth or decline patterns
- Distinguish short-term fluctuations from long-term trends
- Compare performance consistency across industries and businesses

Growth analysis emphasizes directionality rather than absolute values.

## Business Concentration & Dependency
Within-industry ranking and contribution analysis reveals how sales are allocated
among business types. This perspective helps evaluate:
- Degree of market concentration
- Dependency on top-performing entities
- Potential diversification considerations

Highly concentrated industries may carry different risk profiles than more
distributed ones.

## Seasonal Considerations
Seasonal analysis demonstrates how demand varies across months. Recognizing
seasonality supports:
- More accurate performance interpretation
- Improved planning for expansion or scaling activities
- Better alignment between operational and demand cycles

## Investment & Expansion Framing
Rather than identifying specific winners, this analysis establishes a framework
for assessing opportunities based on:
- Consistent performance patterns
- Relative contribution to total sales
- Growth behavior across time

This framework can be reused across datasets or markets.

## Limitations
- Analysis is limited to historical sales data
- External economic or regulatory factors are not included
- Results are sensitive to data granularity and time coverage

## Future Extensions
- Integrate visualization tools (Tableau / Power BI)
- Apply forecasting models to extend trend analysis
- Enrich data with macroeconomic indicators
- Perform margin or profitability analysis if cost data is available

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to transform raw transactional
data into structured analytical insights. The result-agnostic approach ensures
that findings remain robust, interpretable, and reusable for multiple analytical
contexts.
